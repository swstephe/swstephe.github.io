I've been linking to this Github pages site for
years without much of an update.  I saw that I
ended up using this for an online resume, and since
I've been teaching myself JAMStack, which includes
Jekyll, I thought I would reformat this Jekyll
site with resume up front, a list of projects
separate, (updated with more recent projects),
and start this blog.

As a side-challenge, I wanted to get this site
as fast-loading as possible -- already fast
because it is statically generated every time
I "git push", but by using tiny CSS frameworks
like "Skeleton.css" I've got it loading in about
100k.  I think I can squeeze it down even further
by converting from jquery to pure Javascript
so I don't need to load the jquery library from
a CDN.
