I am a software engineer with 30 years of experience.

I was first introduced to computers through a computer
club's TRS-80 and a Commodore 64 while in high school.
    
At Sonoma State University, we mostly did our courses on
CDC Cyber/NOS in Pascal, LISP for artificial intelligence
and some 6502 assembly for digital electronics.  I took
courses in APL and C (the first time the course was offered
there).  In computer graphics, a professor said PC's
were not powerful enough to do ray tracing, which I
responded by writing one for my Timex-Sinclair Spectrum.
I got an A+ in my senior AI class for writing a natural
language translator in LISP that used Esperanto as an
unambiguous intermediate language.  I also had several
jobs, tutoring advanced mathematics and computer science,
creating dBase III reports for the CS department and as
teachers assistant.
    
I picked up some Turbo Prolog and Turbo C++ after college,
while teaching English in Taiwan, R.O.C..
    
I was a data entry contractor for DEC, where I entered
resume data into the HR database.  I worked on some
COBOL reports after I finished all the resumes for the
day and got moved into the manufacturing line reporting
group.
    
I did support at Oracle HQ, then Singapore, then back
at HQ, learning all the Oracle technology at the time.
Working on a CD for Oracle support, I caught the interest
of development and transferred to the Oracle Book team.
On the side, I ported "oraperl", and Oracle database
connector for Perl to Windows.
    
I went to NetGravity and helped port their Python server
code to work in Windows.
    
Back at Oracle, I worked on a PL/SQL web application
development environment.  I also worked on some Java
components, like "parallel portlets" and a JSP compiler.
    
In Brunei, I worked under Siemens ona project with the
country's telecommunication system.  Later I joined
a partnership called GISCOM Sdn. Bhd., maintaining
that telecommunication system, designing GIS maps
for Brunei, and many proposals for government projects
written in Python and Javascript.
    
At Ricoh Innovation Inc., I worked on the Python
middleware on their e-Paper tablet.  I worked on the
virtual keyboard code, wifi manager and bluetooth
interface to scanners, printers and external keyboards.
    
At Bank of the West, I am doing Python development and
appliaction support for their marketing lead generation
systems.  I also manage some Informatica jobs and
interfaces to other providers.  I spend a lot of time
researching Hadoop technologies and getting others
interested in "Big Data".
